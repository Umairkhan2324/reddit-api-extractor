# Reddit Post Viewer

This repository contains a Python script that authenticates with the Reddit API using OAuth (via PRAW) and fetches the 5 latest posts from a specified subreddit. It prints out each post's title, author, and upvote count.

## Features

- **OAuth Authentication:** Securely connects to Reddit using credentials stored in environment variables.
- **Latest Posts:** Fetches and displays the 5 newest posts from any subreddit specified by the user.
- **Error Handling:** Manages authentication failures and API response errors with user-friendly messages.
- **Debug Information:** Prints non-sensitive credential details for debugging purposes (hides the actual password).

## Prerequisites

- **Reddit Account:** You must have a Reddit account.
- **Reddit App:** Create a Reddit application of type **script**. You can do this by visiting [Reddit's App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and creating a new app.
- **Python 3.6+**

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Set up a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install praw python-dotenv
```

Alternatively, if a `requirements.txt` file is provided, install using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Reddit API credentials:

```ini
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent_here
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username_here
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password_here
```

- **REDDIT_CLIENT_ID & REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET:** Found in your Reddit app settings.
- **REDDIT_USER_AGENT:** A custom user agent string (e.g., `script:reddit-post-viewer:v1.0 (by /u/your_username)`).
- **REDDIT_USERNAME & REDDIT_PASSWORD:** Your Reddit account credentials.

## How It Works

1. **Environment Loading:**  
   The script begins by loading environment variables from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.

2. **Authentication:**  
   It retrieves the credentials and creates a Reddit instance using PRAW.  
   - The code first verifies that all required credentials are available.
   - It then attempts to authenticate with the Reddit API by calling `reddit.user.me()`.

3. **Fetching Posts:**  
   The script prompts the user for a subreddit name (defaulting to `python` if no input is provided) and fetches the 5 latest posts from that subreddit using `subreddit.new(limit=5)`.  
   - For each post, it prints the title, author (or "Unknown" if unavailable), and the upvote count.

4. **Error Handling:**  
   The code handles specific exceptions:
   - **OAuthException:** Informs the user if authentication fails and provides possible solutions.
   - **ResponseException:** Displays the API response error details.
   - **General Exception:** Catches and reports any other unexpected errors.

## Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

When prompted, enter the name of a subreddit (or press Enter to default to "python"). The script will then display the title, author, and upvote count for the 5 latest posts in that subreddit.
